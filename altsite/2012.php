    <td colspan="2"><p>Mostly Harmless used our mecanum wheel system. It has an arm  on the front that uses the robot&rsquo;s weight to push down the bridge. Also, Mostly  Harmless had a target tracking system that used hand coded image recognition  software to center the basketball hoops in the camera and thusly the shooter.  Once it is centered, it determines the distance from the hoops. In order to  process this information, a separate computer running Linux is on the robot.  The only thing the driver must do is tell the robot to take the shot. The  shooter itself works almost exactly like a baseball pitching machine. Mostly harmless made it into the play-offs as the eighth  place alliance captains.</p></td>
