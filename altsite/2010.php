          <td colspan="2"><p>Divine Intervention had an eight wheel drive with  pneumatically articulated wheels to easily pass over the bumps without tipping. Our soccer ball kicking mechanism was powered  by surgical tubing. In order to climb the tower, the robot raised on its active  suspension, a hook activated pneumatically and grabbed onto the tower. The hook  then lowered, raising the robot. Divine Intervention was a great defending robot due to it's  high weight and impressive speed. Our active suspension amazed onlookers.  Sadly, our robot&rsquo;s tower climbing mechanism was rarely used in competition.</p></td>
