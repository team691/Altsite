    <td colspan="2"><p>Doom used our tried and tested mecanum wheel system. Doom&rsquo;s  Frisbee shooting mechanism works very similarly to a pitching machine that has  been turned onto its side. In order to shoot from multiple locations possible  the shooter can tilt up and down. In order to allow Doom to ascend to the first  level of the pyramid, the turret tilt had 250 foot pounds of torque in order to  lift the entire robot onto the pyramid. Most notable of Doom's failures was self-inflicted  destruction at the hands of its overly powerful shooter tilt. However, it  proved its ability on defense, at one point it even pushed two robots at once.  It was also capable of consistently scoring in autonomous.</p></td>
