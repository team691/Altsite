    <td colspan="2"><p>For Master Chief, we attempted a mecanum wheel system for  the first time. We designed a forklift to easily bring the inner tubes from  ground level to the top peg in seconds. Team 691 made &ldquo;the claw&rdquo; to grab the  inner tubes which had simple rollers to grab the tubes and hold them in with 45  pounds of force. Our &ldquo;mini-bot,&rdquo; Cortana, could climb the pole in less than 4  seconds. Master Chief is almost certainly the best performing robot  that team 691 has ever built. It made the play-offs in the first competition  and consistently scored 5 inner tubes in the second, easily making it one of  the top 5 scoring robots in that competition.</p></td>
